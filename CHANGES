    - added install tests to verify different games score appropriately, and to verify
      the #29539 BugFix from 0.030
    - BugFix (https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=112715): while adding install tests,
      discovered that scores weren't coming out right when I ran multiple games in the same
      script (for example, switching from literati to scrabble to compare the scores for
      the same board); reset bonus array when initializing a new game.

    - Fix scoring bug -- wilds weren't getting rotated when the rest of the board was, so
      for Y-axis words, it was scoring too much if there was a wild already on the board as
      part of the new word.  (Found while playing Words With Friends: real game scored 2
      points less than Games::Literati::wordswithfriends() because a two-point letter was
      really a wild, but G::L::wwf didn't notice.)  FIX = Swap row/col during wilds
      comparison.

    - Replace hardcoded "Scrabble/Literati" printed title with our $GameName-dependent text
    - Sprinkle comments throughout the code, to help me understand and debug it better
    - Update/expand POD documentation
    - BUGFIX: change the "cross-word" scoring (if you lay down a horizontal set of tiles,
      the "cross-words" are any vertical words that are created) to check the wilds under
      new tiles in the cross-word don't get scored, but that new tiles that are part of the
      cross-word are scored (and include bonuses) = fixed the array indexing in the unless
      (wild), and fixed the logic so if it's not wild, it does score.
